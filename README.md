# Seattle Airbnb Data

As someone who is constantly looking into traveling and exploring different locations, the chance to view Airbnb data and come to a bigger understanding of what to expect when traveling and finding housing was very motivating for me. 


To view the results found in this repository one needs the following libraries and files
Libraries:   
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

files:
<li>project.ipynb - jypter notebook with cleaning of the data and statistics done on the data</li>
<li>Calendar.csv - Airbnb data of the dates when listings are available or not</li>
<li>Listings.csv - Airbnb data with information about each listing, including information about the host</li>

Through my findings, I concluded I had unrealistic ideas of what should be expected when looking into a region and finding a proper location to stay. While there are many different factors that come into play when deciding on where one should stay when they travel, the data shows that on average most options are strong choices; this reduces a natural worry someone might have to face when worrying if they are picking the right choice or not.
